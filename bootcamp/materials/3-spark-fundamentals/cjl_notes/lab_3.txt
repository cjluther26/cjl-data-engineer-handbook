#### PySpark Job Scripts #####
- In the examples, `def main()` is the literal job (builds the Spark Session, builds the DataFrame, adds to table...)
- To make these jobs more "testable", create another function OUTSIDE where you build/write data that just does the transformation logic!
    - This allows you to isolate and test the logic in the query, ensuring that it works propery!
    - Ex. In `players_scd_job.py`, `do_player_scd_transformation()` represents just the transformations, while `main()` does the actual
          building/writing. We can easily comment out code and test `do_player_scd_transformation()` to make sure our SQL is correct!
 
 - This lab went through `team_vertex_job.py` and its associated pytest.
